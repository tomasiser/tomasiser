Hello! 🏄‍♂️

I got my PhD in Computer Graphics in 2023 and currently, I am an academic researcher and teacher at the [Computer Graphics Group](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz) at [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html) and a co-founder of [Additive Appearance](https://appearan.cz/) focusing on high-quality color 3D printing.
