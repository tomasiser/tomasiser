Hello, ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student at [Computer Graphics Group](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz) under the supervision of [Alexander Wilkie](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~wilkie/), formerly [Jaroslav KÅ™ivÃ¡nek](http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~jaroslav/).

My research focuses on **visual computing**, which is a computer science field encompassing real-time and offline computer graphics, image processing, appearance fabrication, 3D printing, and more.
